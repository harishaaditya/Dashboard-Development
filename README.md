This Power BI dashboard project is a comprehensive analysis of global video game sales. The objective is to extract meaningful patterns and insights from the sales data to inform decision-making across marketing, product development, and business strategy within the video game industry. The dataset, named "vgsales," includes various metrics such as global sales, regional sales (NA, EU, JP, Other), genre, platform, publisher, and time-based dimensions.
